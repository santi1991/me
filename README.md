# Welcome to my Website!

Hi! my name is **Santiago**. I created this website in order to show you more about me, my education, skills and some projects I have done as a entry-level frontend developer. 
[Welcome! - click here to check out my website](https://santi1991.github.io/me/)

> I consider myself a self learner
> who is very passionate about JavaScript
> and the world of React and React Native. 

## Who am I as a developer?
- Core knowledge of HTML and responsive CSS.
- `JavaScript` libraries **React** and **React Native** to create awesome multi-platform sites and applications. 
- I accomplish the state management of my projects by using React Context along with its `useContext`, `useReducer` and `useState` hooks. I do not use a library such as Redux. 
- To perform overall optimizations, using React High Order Components such as `React.memo`, altogether with `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks when needed. Special cases should implement `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`.
- Although at the beginning I am focusing on developing my frontend skills, I have some knowledge on using Firebase and Google Cloud Platform by deploying some projects using their services, implementing a **postgreSQL** database.

## How I worked on my projects
These are some of the libraries I usually implement:
### for `React` projects
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - brings functionality to the UI navigation components.
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - Provides React components to easily develop the UI of Web Applications.
### for `React Native` projects
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - brings functionality to the UI. navigation components.
- [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) - collection of customizable and production-ready components for React Native.
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) - framework and a platform for universal React applications.

### `...and many others!`

There are plenty of libraries and tools that helps me build my projects.
- [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) used to translante the site and making it multilanguage.

## What's next...
- Keep a **postgreSQL** instance up for my projects.
- Improve knowledge and skills with the usage of [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) , or get familiar with a new one such as [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [supabase](https://supabase.io/) or [Nhost](https://nhost.io/).
