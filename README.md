# Welcome to my Website

[Hello World! - Check out my website](https://santi1991.github.io/me/).\
So you can get to know me a little better, I created this website about me... enjoy!

## About the Site

This project was created with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

I consider myself a self learner who fell in love with `React`, `React Native` and `JavaScript`.\
On this path to create applications, I am very passionate about creating **React Native apps**.\
I build my projects using most of the React Hooks to manage the state of the app and to optimize it.\
I also find very useful tools such as `Google Firebase` and `Google Cloud Platform` together with `PostgreSQL`.\
to build and deploy real world applications.  

## Additional Libraries

The following libraries were used to bring this site alive:

### `Material-UI`

Provides React components to easily develop the UI of Web Applications.\
Open [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) to check out this awesome library.

The Website uses these components to not only look beautiful, but also responsive.\
You will also see some cool navigation components in action.

### `React Router`

It helps you bring functionality to the UI navigation components.\
The library provies Navigational Components, ckeck it out [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for more information.

### `...and many others!`

There are plenty of libraries and tools that helps me build the app for production.\
For example, one of them is the one I used to translante the site and making it multilanguage.\

Take a look [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) for more information.
